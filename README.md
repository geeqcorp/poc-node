# GEEQ Proof of Concept
## Validating Node & Hub

The GEEQ Proof of Concept is being written as a RESTful service written in NodeJS. We're looking to get to a functional PoC as quickly as we can. Although our work is being committed to the repository on a regular basis, the code isn't functional yet. Every commit gets us one step closer.

This read me will be updated regularly to report the overall progress on the PoC. Please join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/GeeqChainOfficial) to connect with the growing GEEQ community. You can also get more information at [geeq.io](http://geeq.io/).
